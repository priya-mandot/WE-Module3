Generate a code in python according to the given requirements:
Collatz Sequence

Implement a function to generate a sequence starting with any positive integer N, Collatz sequence is defined corresponding to n as the numbers formed by the following operations :

* If n is even, then n = n / 2.
* If n is odd, then n = 3*n + 1.

Example:

* collatz_seq(3) --> 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

* collatz_seq(9) --> 9, 28, 14, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

## ChatGPT

Here's a Python function to generate the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer N:

```python

def collatz_seq(N):
    sequence = [N]  # Initialize the sequence with the starting number N

    while N != 1:
        if N % 2 == 0:
            N = N // 2
        else:
            N = 3 * N + 1
        sequence.append(N)  # Append the next number to the sequence

    return sequence

# Test cases
print(collatz_seq(3))  # Output: [3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
print(collatz_seq(9))  # Output: [9, 28, 14, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
```

This function takes a positive integer N as input and generates the Collatz sequence until it reaches 1. It returns the sequence as a list.

Add a few comments explaining the logic so it is clear to everyone in the team.

## ChatGPT

Certainly! Here's the code with comments added to explain the logic:

```python

def collatz_seq(N):
    sequence = [N]  # Initialize the sequence with the starting number N

    while N != 1:
        # If N is even, divide it by 2
        if N % 2 == 0:
            N = N // 2
        # If N is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1
        else:
            N = 3 * N + 1
        sequence.append(N)  # Append the next number to the sequence

    return sequence

# Test cases
print(collatz_seq(3))  # Output: [3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
print(collatz_seq(9))  # Output: [9, 28, 14, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
```
Now, the code includes comments explaining each step of the Collatz sequence generation process, making it clear to everyone in the team how the function works.

## User
Write 5 new test cases for this to ensure the code logic is giving correct results. Try to cover any edge cases if there.

## ChatGPT

Here are five additional test cases covering a range of scenarios, including edge cases:

```python

# Additional test cases
print(collatz_seq(1))  # Output: [1]
print(collatz_seq(2))  # Output: [2, 1]
print(collatz_seq(7))  # Output: [7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
print(collatz_seq(10)) # Output: [10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
print(collatz_seq(100)) # Output: [100, 50, 25, 76, 38, 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]

These test cases include:

    N = 1: This tests the sequence for the smallest possible positive integer.
    N = 2: This tests the sequence for a small even number.
    N = 7: This tests the sequence for a prime number.
    N = 10: This tests the sequence for a typical positive integer.
    N = 100: This tests the sequence for a relatively larger number.
```
## User
Code such that on running the test cases , the system displays if the given output matched the expected output or not?

## ChatGPT

You can achieve this by comparing the actual output generated by the function with the expected output for each test case. Here's how you can modify the code to display whether the actual output matches the expected output or not:



```python
def test_collatz_seq():
    test_cases = [
        (3, [3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]),
        (9, [9, 28, 14, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]),
        (1, [1]),
        (2, [2, 1]),
        (7, [7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]),
        (10, [10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]),
        (100, [100, 50, 25, 76, 38, 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1])
    ]

    for N, expected_output in test_cases:
        actual_output = collatz_seq(N)
        if actual_output == expected_output:
            print(f"Test case passed for N = {N}")
        else:
            print(f"Test case failed for N = {N}: Expected {expected_output}, but got {actual_output}")

```
Run the test cases
test_collatz_seq()

This code defines a function test_collatz_seq() which contains all the test cases along with their expected outputs. For each test case, it runs the collatz_seq() function and compares the actual output with the expected output. If they match, it prints a message indicating that the test case passed. If they don't match, it prints a message indicating that the test case failed along with the expected and actual outputs.
